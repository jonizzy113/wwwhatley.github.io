Utilizing component methods like constructor(), render(), and setState(), you tell React what you want the UI to look like and its out of the box goodies take care of the DOM manipulation. Its wide-spread adoption is attributed to React's lightning-fast, modern look and feel. Since using it myself, I've built some really cool applications. The React ecosystem is full, vibrant, and seemingly here to stay. If you're looking at JavaScript and are wondering what framework to pick up, I would recommend React.

Even better, when you collect so many points, you can plant  REAL trees. So back up, what's a pomodoro clock? It's a methodology of working in  25 minute intervals, with 5 minute breaks in between. Why is this effective? Because  work is more deliberate when you are allocating a small amount of time to a particular  task. I remember long back, I had a near 20 page proposal to complete--not a light  task--especially when it's a highly technical document. This may have normally taken  me a few days to complete--with the pomodoro method, I was able to complete the entire  thing start-to-finish in a matter of hours. Because 25 minutes is far less overwhelming  than looking at a complex task.
