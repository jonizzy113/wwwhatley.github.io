_Robotics, drones, digital disruption and a rapid increase in video technologies creates new opportunities in the media industry._

<p class="firstChar">Coming from someone not previously in the media industry, I can say my experience at NAB Show in Las Vegas was absolutely incredible. The clear and apparent consumer demand for media and entertainment seems to be reaching new heights as we integrate digitized content into every facet of our day-to-day lives — this creates new horizons of opportunity with collected data from user consumption.</p>

I’ve easily been to a couple dozen or more conferences, all in the tech space, and never have I left as in awe as I did at NAB show — a nerd through and through, the industry does not disappoint with its offerings of the latest and greatest robotics, drones, and cutting-edge hardware and software technologies.

##I wanted to take a moment to share some of our key takeaways from this year’s NAB show in Las Vegas:

###Man and machine — the future intertwined with our Robotic friends…

Major players such as Nikon and DJI were front and center with the latest advances in robotic technologies… and boy was it impressive. Apart from the same aerial photography we see on our feeds everyday now, drones actually play a major role in professional film production. Several $20,000 drones mounted with Red Cameras or the likes were found throughout NAB’s exhibit halls.

###Video… EVERYWHERE — The explosion in video technologies will continue to become more and more accessible to the consumer.

Cool huh? We’re in the age of digital consumption and this isn’t a trend that is predicted to slow at all — on the contrary, we may soon have access to our favorite feeds, content, and background noise everywhere. A new frontier of video technologies demands cognitive integrations, with voice-to-text compiling, we’re able to understand viewer habits better than ever. Understanding viewer habits allows the flexibility of molding and creating an experience specifically tailored to that of the individual.

###Although the same in-your-face names are sprinkled everywhere, the industry clearly has room for many new faces.

With new trends in the digital economy comes new opportunities for those small and agile enough to deliver right in the hands of the consumer. Although names like Microsoft, Canon, Sony, Amazon, and Vimeo have the resources and know-how to stay one-step ahead of the current trends, their sheer size and defined way of doing things often creates stagnancy — this allows new faces to emerge in an industry that has been around for centuries.
